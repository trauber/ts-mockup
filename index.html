<p>
Temple Sinai conducts weekly Friday night and Saturday morning,
Shabbat services. Services are generally at 7:00 p.m. on Friday evening
and 10 a.m. on Saturday morning. It is always a good idea to check the
"Happenings" or call the office
<a href='tel:8568290658'>
(856 829-0658)
</a>
to check the Service schedule recording. Service times can
also be found on our
<a href='https://www.templesinainj.com/site/calendar'>
website calendar.
</a>
</p>
<p>
Most months a Shabbat Service is designated as a Family Service. This
service is oriented toward the children and includes participation from
the children in our Religious School, who are expected to attend.
Consult the Bulletin for dates and times.
</p>
<p>
Every other month Temple Sinai holds a Tot Shabbat. This lively
interactive Friday night service is especially for young children (six
years old and younger) and their families. During a Tot Shabbat service,
we celebrate the beauty and wonder of Shabbat through singing, dancing,
and story telling, as well as teach basic Shabbat prayers, songs and
rituals. Oneg Shabbat refreshments follow the service. Tot Shabbat is a
wonderful way to introduce your toddler or preschooler to Jewish worship
and to other children in the Temple Sinai community in a relaxed
atmosphere. The Tot Shabbat is held at 7:00 pm and usually lasts 30 to
45 minutes. Please refer to the Bulletin for dates.
</p>
<p>
Services for the High Holidays are held on Slichot night, Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Morning services begin at 9:30 am and are held
in the Main Sanctuary, led by Rabbi Reaboi. A Family Service for
children and their parents lasts about 1 hour and is held in the chapel
at 9:30 a.m. Refreshments are available for the children. Call 856
829-0658 for more information. Congregants will receive High Holiday
tickets, with service schedules, in the mail. Tickets are required for
admission into the main High Holiday Services for security reasons, and
are included as part of your dues. Seating is on a first come basis.
</p>
<h2>Torah Spark</h2>

spark, where we read through the weekly Torah portion and discuss it
from several different perspectives: theological, cultural, political,
