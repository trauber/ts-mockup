Vision
</h1>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Our building will be full of members of all ages, filled with Baruch
Habah (welcome) humility, ruach, and religious experiences to fit every
stage of Jewish life.
</li>
<li>
Acknowledging our responsibility for one another, we will pledge our
talents and resources to assure the well-being of our community.
</li>
<li>
We will conduct the business of the synagogue with compassion,
integrity, fiscal and environmental responsibility.
</li>
<li>
All segments of the synagogue will work together respectfully; the
leadership, the clergy, the school, the staff, and the congregants.
</li>
<li>
Fulfilling our commitment to Conservative Judaism, we will actively
participate in the Conservative Movement as a contemporary and
progressive community.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
We Are a Caring Community
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Where Jewish values are learned and lived in all aspects of
synagogue life and is evident in the way we speak with and care for one
another.
</li>
<li>
Where we will celebrate with you in times of joy and support you in
times of need.
</li>
<li>Where we will accept you for whom you are.</li>
<li>
Where we aspire to be a community where strangers become friends and
friends become family, and we nurture each other on our paths to
spirituality and wholeness.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Religion and Spirituality
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Realizing we all pray differently, we will provide opportunities for
prayers that are meaningful and relevant to a diverse community.
</li>
<li>
Our Services will provide opportunities to explore your own
understanding of being Jewish whether sitting in the congregation or
leading from the bema.
</li>
<li>
We will continue to be tolerant and respectful of others’ practice
of Judaism and other religions and knowledgeable enough to know the
differences.
</li>
<li>
We will provide opportunities for religious growth whether it be
leading services, reading Torah, blowing shofar, or participating in
sermon dialog or study brunches.
</li>
<li>
Recognizing the increasing rate of intermarriage, we will welcome
the non-Jewish partner and offer opportunities for meaningful
participation for the entire family.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Support for Israel
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
As a congregation and as individuals, we will have a strong
connection to Israel.
</li>
<li>
We will aspire to the Ahavat Yisrael model – a love for Israel and
the Jewish people.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tikkun Olam</h2>
<ul>
<li>
We will engage in Tikum Olam – repair of the world through social
and economic justice, environmental stewardship, understanding through
interfaith dialog, deeds of loving-kindness, and B’Shalom (in
peace).
</li>
<li>
We will follow the Shema which directs us to be responsible for one
another. We will commit with our hearts, souls, and material resources
to help those in need.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Education
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
As education is integral to living Jewish lives, we will commit
ourselves to life-long Jewish study.
</li>
<li>
We aspire to offer high-quality learning opportunities for our
entire community.
</li>
<li>Our educational opportunities will prepare us to live Jewishly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these ways and more, we shall be a Kehilah Kedoshah &#8212; A Holy
Community.
